# Adventure Game
This is a game created at the introduction programming course at KYH for the 23 year students.

## Purpose
The purpose of this game is for the students (and teacher) to have something fun to do at the same time as we are teaching the course, instead of the same old boring small examples.

## Game World
The game world is in the form of a matrix.

User is always looking up when standing in a room.
  
Map:  
   -------------			K = Kitchen  
   |   |   |   |			B = Banquett hall  
   | K / B | T |			T = Tickeling chamber  
   |   |   |   |			C = Cell  
   ------/---/--			H = Hallway  
   |   |   |   |			W = Wardrobe  
   | C / H / w |  
   |   |   |   |  
   ------/------  
  
By walking around you can see the different rooms. If you are lucky there are items in the room you can find.
